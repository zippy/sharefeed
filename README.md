# ShareFeed

ShareFeed allows a group of people to share websites, videos, and other web content with each other. It features a dead-simple UI suitable for users of all technical levels, designed to replace mindless social media scrolling with meaningful relational sharing.

## Overview

ShareFeed consists of two components across two repositories:

1. **This repo (`sharefeed`)** - Holochain app, UI, and browser extension
2. **[`sharefeed-desktop`](https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/sharefeed-desktop)** - Desktop app wrapper (based on Kangaroo)

All data is stored on the Holochain distributed network, giving you full ownership and control of your data.

## Installation

### Desktop App

1. Download the latest release from [sharefeed-desktop releases](https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/sharefeed-desktop/releases)
2. Run the installer for your platform:
   - **Windows**: Run `ShareFeed-Setup.exe`
   - **macOS**: Open `ShareFeed.dmg` and drag to Applications
   - **Linux**: Run `ShareFeed.AppImage` or install the `.deb` package

### Browser Extension

#### From Release (Recommended)

1. Download `sharefeed-extension.zip` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/sharefeed/releases)
2. Unzip to a folder on your computer
3. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`
4. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the unzipped folder
6. The ShareFeed icon will appear in your browser toolbar

#### From Source

```bash
cd extension
npm install
npm run build
```
Then load the `extension/dist` folder as an unpacked extension.

## Usage

1. **Start the Desktop App** - Launch ShareFeed from your applications
2. **Share Content** - Click the ShareFeed icon in your browser while viewing any webpage
3. **Add Details** - Optionally add a note or highlight specific text
4. **View Feed** - Open the desktop app to see shares from your group

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (for Holochain development)
- [Holochain CLI tools](https://developer.holochain.org/get-started/)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone both repositories
git clone https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/sharefeed.git
git clone https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/sharefeed-desktop.git

cd sharefeed
npm install

cd ../sharefeed-desktop
yarn install
```

```

### Running in Development

#### Holochain App + UI (without desktop wrapper)

```bash
# Start with one agent
npm run start

# Start with two agents (for testing multi-user)
npm run start:2
```

#### Extension Only

```bash
cd extension
npm run dev
```
Then load `extension/dist` as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

#### Full Desktop App

```bash
# In sharefeed repo: build and deploy webhapp
npm run deploy:desktop

# In sharefeed-desktop repo: run the desktop app
cd ../sharefeed-desktop
yarn dev
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Integration tests only
npm run test:integration
```

### Building for Release

#### Extension

```bash
# Creates sharefeed-extension.zip in repo root
npm run package:extension
```

#### Desktop App (Local)

```bash
# In sharefeed repo: build webhapp
npm run package

# Copy to desktop repo
cp workdir/sharefeed.webhapp ../sharefeed-desktop/pouch/

# In sharefeed-desktop: build for your platform
cd ../sharefeed-desktop
yarn build:linux    # or build:win, build:mac-arm64, build:mac-x64
```

### Release Process (CI)

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions across both repositories.

#### 1. Release the hApp/WebHapp (this repo)

```bash
# Update version in package.json
# Commit changes

# Tag and push to trigger CI build
git tag happ-v0.1.0
git push origin happ-v0.1.0
```

This triggers `.github/workflows/release-webhapp.yaml` which:
- Builds the webhapp using nix
- Creates a draft GitHub release with `sharefeed.webhapp` and `sharefeed.happ`
- Outputs SHA256 checksums

#### 2. Release the Extension (this repo)

```bash
git tag ext-v0.1.0
git push origin ext-v0.1.0
```

This triggers `.github/workflows/release-extension.yaml` which:
- Builds and zips the extension
- Creates a draft GitHub release with `sharefeed-extension.zip`

#### 3. Release the Desktop App (sharefeed-desktop repo)

After the webhapp release is published:

1. Update `kangaroo.config.ts` in sharefeed-desktop:
   ```typescript
   webhapp: {
     url: 'https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/sharefeed/releases/download/happ-v0.1.0/sharefeed.webhapp',
     sha256: '<sha256-from-release>',
   },
   ```

2. Push to the `release` branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout release
   git merge main
   git push origin release
   ```

This triggers the desktop release workflow which builds installers for:
- Windows (.exe)
- macOS (x86 and arm64 .dmg)
- Linux (.AppImage and .deb)

## Architecture

### Holochain Backend

ShareFeed uses Holochain for decentralized data storage and peer-to-peer networking:

- **No central server** - Data is stored across participants' devices
- **Cryptographic identity** - Each user has a unique keypair
- **DHT storage** - Shares are distributed across the network

### Browser Extension

The extension connects directly to the local Holochain conductor:

- **Fixed ports** - Admin: 21211, App: 21212
- **WebSocket connection** - Uses @holochain/client
- **Fallback storage** - Local storage when Holochain unavailable

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests (`npm test`)
5. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
6. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
7. Open a Pull Request

### Development Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code style
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
